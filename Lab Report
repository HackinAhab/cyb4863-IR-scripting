# Part 3: Reflections on Automation Based on Preparation and Detection Phase of Asset Inventory and Suspicious Login Monitoring

## Inventory Script

### Introduction

We developed two Python scripts: the Inventory Script and the Login Detection Script. The Inventory Script identifies active users, installed software, missing patches, and monitors running processes and USB history. It also detects privileged sudo users, ensuring comprehensive system oversight and security.

### Script's Purpose

The Python script was created and adapted to:
- Identify active users, installed software, and missing patches.
- Monitor listening services, running processes, and USB connection history.
- Detect privileged sudo users.

### Findings

- **Active Users**: 2 users, with 1 having root access.
- **Installed Applications**: Over 50, including security tools.
- **Missing Security Patches**: Detected for critical software.
- **USB Connections**: Recent connections logged with potential security risks.
- **Sudo Privileges**: Unrestricted privileges for a user increased risks.

## Login Detection Script

### Script Type/Purpose

This Python script monitors login attempts from authentication logs. It detects repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address and blocks brute-force attackers after 5 failed attempts. It also monitors privileged account logins for unusual access.

### Key Findings

- **Brute Force Attacks**: Detected and blocked from a remote IP.
- **Privileged Account Logins**: Logged for security review.
- **Detection Accuracy**: Successfully simulated failed logins and verified accuracy.

## Reflections on Automation

### Speed

- Instant threat detection and response.

### Consistency

- Standardized security monitoring.

### Efficiency

- Reducing manual security workload.

### Scalability

- Deploying across multiple systems.

### Lessons Learned

- Handling log file access restrictions and log rotations.
- Improving email alerts, GeoIP tracking, and database logging for forensic analysis.

## Conclusion

To strengthen our knowledge of system security, we developed two Python scripts: the Inventory Script and the Login Detection Script. These scripts automate critical monitoring tasks, enhancing security oversight and threat detection efficiency.
